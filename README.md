# Whack-A-Mole
Whack a Mole App for Software Engineering Project

# Project Description
- Build a simple whack-mole-game for a mobile app or desktop platform of your choice.
- On commencement of play, the game should present a small circle on the deviceâ€™s screen at a random location.
- The player should touch the screen at the position of the circle, whereupon the circle should disappear, and a new circle should be placed at some random location elsewhere on the screen (at least 10% of the screen width away from the original circle placement).
- If the player fails to touch the circle within 1 second, the circle should disappear, and a new circle should appear as if the player had touched it. 
- This should game play should repeat for 60 seconds, at which point in time the game should end, and a score should be presented in terms of number of circles touched.
